# Breakout Game

A game made using React, Tailwind CSS and HTML5 Canvas API. 

This is my first time working with canvas and it was difficult integrating it with React. There's not a lot of documentation or examples of games using a React framework, using functional components and canvas.

Additionally it was challenging because this is my first time working with many different custom hooks and states. I used Context API to store the game state. 

It's not an optimal way to make a game, but it was a good exercise. Currently this game only has desktop support as I will still need to learn how to take in user inputs for mobile.
